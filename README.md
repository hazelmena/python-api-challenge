# python-api-challenge
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"
Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?
Before You Begin

Create a new repository for this project called python-api-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.
Clone the new repository to your computer.
Inside your local Git repository, create a directory for this assignment. Use a folder name that corresponds to the Challenges, such as WeatherPy.
Inside the folder you just created, add the files called api_keys.py, WeatherPy.ipynb, and VacationPy.ipynb that you will find in the starter code ZIP file provided. These will be the main scripts to run for each analysis.
Before you push your changes to GitHub, add a .gitignore file.
